# SIR-Model
This is a simulation of the SIR Model.

The parameters have been taken from the following website:
https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/loci/joma/the-sir-model-for-spread-of-disease-the-differential-equation-model

There are two implementations of the SIR model. The file `Virus spread.ipynb` contains an SIR implementation using the agentpy module which can be found here: https://agentpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/agentpy_virus_spread.html
